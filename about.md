Hey there! My name is Dalibor Nasevic.

<img alt="Dalibor Nasevic" src="/assets/dalibor.nasevic.photo.jpg" title="Dalibor Nasevic">

I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalibornasevic" target="_blank" title="My LinkedIn profile">Senior Principal Engineer</a> at <a href="https://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>, specializing in Ruby, AWS, and Email Delivery. I have built a highly scalable and available, cloud-ready email delivery platform that runs on AWS infrastructure and on-premise, delivering billions of customer emails.

Prior to joining GoDaddy, I worked as a Software Consultant helping startups and companies using Ruby on Rails. I co-founded <a href="/posts/6-announcing-macedonian-ruby-user-group-mkrug">MKRUG</a> and facilitated several <a href="/posts/74-notes-from-global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-in-skopje">Coderetreat</a> events sharing the Software Craftsmanship values and the <a href="/posts/23-extreme-programming-wisdom">eXtreme Programming</a> principles and practices.

In 2010, I stumbled upon Titanium Mobile and won the award for the <a href="/posts/15-vip-android-challenge-grand-prix-with-popravimk">best mobile application</a> at the first Android challenge in Macedonia, organized by VIP mobile operator.

In 2018, I moved to Belgrade, Serbia where I enjoy attending football and basketball games.
