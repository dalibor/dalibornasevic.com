I'm Dalibor Nasevic, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalibornasevic" target="_blank">Senior Principal Software Engineer</a> at <a href="https://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a>.

I architect and scale email systems at GoDaddy handling billions of messages for customers and internal teams. My work spans system design, AWS and on-premises infrastructure, deliverability, and email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).

Before GoDaddy, I worked as a consultant helping startups build products with Ruby on Rails. I co-founded <a href="/posts/6-announcing-macedonian-ruby-user-group-mkrug">MKRUG</a> (Macedonian Ruby User Group) and facilitated <a href="/posts/74-notes-from-global-day-of-coderetreat-2016-in-skopje">Coderetreat</a> events, sharing <a href="/posts/23-extreme-programming-wisdom">eXtreme Programming</a> practices with the local developer community.

In 2010, I won the <a href="/posts/15-vip-android-challenge-grand-prix-with-popravimk">best mobile application</a> award at the first Android challenge in Macedonia.

Currently I'm based in Belgrade, Serbia. You can reach me via <a href="mailto:dalibor.nasevic@gmail.com">email</a>.
