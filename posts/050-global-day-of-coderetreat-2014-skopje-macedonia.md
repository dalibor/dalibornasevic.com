Skopje is participating in the 4th annual [Global Day of Coderetreat 2014](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/). The event will be held on Saturday, November 15th at Ever-Near office. There are few spots left, so hurry up to [register](http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2014-skopje-macedonia).

Coderetreat is a day long event of practicing object-oriented software design with focus on the [4 rules of simple design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules). It's a great chance to meet other developers in our community and learn more about development techniques like test driven development and pair programming. You should know at least some basics on how to program and bring your laptop.
