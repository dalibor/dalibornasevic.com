Several changes happened on my professional plan in the last few months, and I didn't have the time to update my blog. But, here is the chance for doing that.

A month ago I left [Aspekt](http://www.aspekt.com.mk/ "Aspekt official site"), the previous company I worked for. I spent about 2.5 years there working on several large Ruby on Rails projects and one Javascript / jQuery project for bwin gaming company. I needed a change in the working environment, so I decided to leave.

Few weeks ago I started working for [Siyelo](http://siyelo.com/ "Siyelo official site"), joining them on several active Ruby on Rails projects. It's a challenge to learn few existing projects at once and get them under control. Currently I work from home, the atmosphere is very good and dynamic. We often do pair programming with other team members. Our aspirations as a team are quite high, so the most interesting is yet to come!

At the same time, I also have few side projects (some of them open-source). More about them in the upcoming posts.
