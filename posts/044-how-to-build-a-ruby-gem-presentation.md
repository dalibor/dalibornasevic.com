Last month I gave a talk at the local [MK Ruby Users Group](http://ruby.mk/ "Ruby Macedonia") on how to build a Ruby Gem. It was a bit of history and then a practical guide on building a gem and an overview of what it involves to maintain it. You can find my slides from the presentation on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/dalibor/how-to-build-a-ruby-gem "How to Build a Ruby Gem").

In the talk I used my solution to the **mars rover** problem. It's a good example to demonstrate some best practices about project structure, naming conventions, coding principles and testing with Ruby. You can find the source code for it on  [github](https://github.com/dalibor/mars_rover "Mars Rover problem ruby solution").
