I was facilitating the [Global Day of Coderetreat event in Skopje (Macedonia)](http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-in-skopje-macedonia "Global Day of Coderetreat in Skopje (Macedonia)") (photos available [here](http://coderetreat.org/photo/albums/skopje-coderetreat "Global Day of Coderetreat in Skopje (Macedonia): Photos")).

_What is Global Day of Coderetreat?_

[Global Day of Coderetreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/ "Global Day of Coderetreat") is a world-wide event celebrating passion and software craftsmanship. Over 2200 passionate software developers in 90 cities around the world spend the day practicing the craft of software development using the [Coderetreat format](http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/structure-of-a-coderetreat "Coderetreat format").

_What went well?_

- Skopje was a part of the Global Day of Coderetreat (Global Coderetreat [map](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/ "Global Day of Coderetreat map"))
- Pair programming knowledge transfer (participants worked in: Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java and some Erlang at the end)
- Direct connect with the event in Barcelona (El Clásico discussion was fun! :) thanks to [Jaume Jornet](https://twitter.com/#%21/jaumejornet "Jaume Jornet"))
- 3 local sponsors (big thanks to: [Siyelo](http://siyelo.com/ "Siyelo"), [Atomidata](http://atomidata.com/ "Atomidata") and [Ever-Near](http://ever-near.com/ "Ever-Near"))

_What could be improved?_

- Attendance (there were only 3 pairs - 6 developers; +2 or just +1 pair could have made a big difference)
- Focus (we had only 4 good focused sessions practicing software design, and 2 freestyle sessions; with +1 pair it could have been better)

All in all, it was great experience for me organizing this Coderetreat event. I learned many new ideas about Software Design and Agile Coaching.
