For those that missed the news, we won the [Grand Prix](http://www.flickr.com/photos/it_com_mk/5003633679/in/set-72157624863051331/lightbox/ "Vip Android Grand Prix") as the best mobile application on the Android challenge organized by [Vip](http://android.vip.mk/winners "Winners from Vip Android contest") mobile operator in Macedonia.

[PopraviMK](http://popravi.mk "PopraviMK official site") is a public service for reporting local problems. I build a Ruby on Rails web service and mobile application for the Android platform using the Titanium mobile framework.

People can use both applications to report problems they have found in public areas, and institutions can respond to their requests and solve the problems.

Will institutions do that? That’s the question we are trying to answer in the next period. We are preparing a presentation for the municipalities on how they can get involved and play an active role in the system.

We were two members of the team working on developing this service. I did all the programming stuff, and Dime Pashoski worked on the design.

[Titanium mobile](http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/ "Titanium Framework") is a framework for developing mobile applications. I had no previous experience with it, and this was an interesting experiment. Titanium Framework gave me the power and speed to develop a mobile application quickly with Javascript. It’s still in very active development, and its version for iPhone seems to be much more stable than the Android one. That means the development process of the Android application wasn’t enjoyable, although I would say that it’s far more pleasant than writing it in Java. :)

I will write more technical centers about the Titanium framework in the future.
