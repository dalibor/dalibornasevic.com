Hello everyone! I'm Dalibor, and this is my blog. The software behind it, for now, is a simple Ruby on Rails application, and you can find its source code on [Github](https://github.com/dalibor/dalibornasevic.com "Dalibor Nasevic's blog").

Building something from scratch is to have complete control of what it can do and an opportunity to learn more by maintaining and upgrading it. It's a playground to experiment with, from TDD and writing software to configuring VPS, web servers, deployments, and all the other fun stuff.
