Hello everyone! I'm Dalibor and this is my personal blog. The software behind it for now is a simple Ruby on Rails application and you can find its source code on [Github](https://github.com/dalibor/dalibornasevic.com "Dalibor Nasevic's blog").

The reason for building something from scratch is having full control of what it can do and also having an opportunity to learn more by maintaining and upgrading it. It's a playground to experiment, from TDD and writing software to configuring VPS, web servers, deploymenents and all the other fun stuff.
