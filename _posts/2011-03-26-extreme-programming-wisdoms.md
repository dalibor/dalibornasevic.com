An excerpt from the "Extreme Programming Explained" book by Kent Beck:

- If code reviews are good, we'll review code all the time (pair programming).
- If testing is good, everybody will test all the time (unit testing), even the customers (functional testing).
- If design is good, we'll make it part of everybody's daily business (refactoring). 
- If simplicity is good, we'll always leave the system with the simplest design that supports its current functionality (the simplest thing that could possibly work). 
- If architecture is important, everybody will work defining and refining the architecture all the time (metaphor).
- If integration testing is important, then we'll integrate and test several times a day (continuous integration).
- If short iterations are good, we'll make the iterations really, really short - seconds and minutes and hours, not weeks and months and years (the planning game).
