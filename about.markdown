Hi, I'm Dalibor Nasević.

<img alt="Dalibor Nasević" src="/assets/dalibor.nasevic.photo.jpg" title="Dalibor Nasević">

I'm a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalibornasevic" target="_blank" title="My LinkedIn profile">Principal Software Engineer</a> at <a href="https://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> working on the email delivery infrastructure for <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/online-marketing/email-marketing" target="_blank">GoDaddy Email Marketing</a> and <a href="https://madmimi.com" target="_blank">Mad Mimi</a>. My primary focus is architecture design and development of scalable and robust services. My core expertise is with Ruby, AWS and Email Delivery. I put an accent on the "how" using <a href="/posts/23-extreme-programming-wisdoms">eXtreme Programming</a> practices.

Prior to GoDaddy, I was working as a Software Consultant helping startups and companies working with Ruby on Rails. I co-founded <a href="/posts/6-announcing-macedonian-ruby-user-group-mkrug">Macedonian Ruby User Group</a> and facilitated several <a href="/posts?tag=coderetreat">Coderetreat</a> events sharing the Software Craftsmanship values.

In 2010, I did an experiment with Titanium Mobile and was awarded for the <a href="/posts/15-vip-android-challenge-grand-prix-with-popravimk">best mobile application</a> at the first Android challenge in Macedonia organized by VIP mobile operator.

In 2018, I moved to Belgrade, Serbia.
